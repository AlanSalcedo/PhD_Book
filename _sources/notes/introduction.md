# UHE Neutrinos: Why should you care about them?

Neutrinos at energies above  10<sup>16</sup> eV, ultra-high energy (UHE) neutrinos, are the only particles that can be used to probe astrophysical sources outside of our galaxy at the highest energies. Neutrinos have neutral charge and small cross sections that make them travel undisturbed through cosmic distances. UHE neutrinos remain undetected despite our strong motivations to expect an observable flux on Earth. UHE neutrinos are then an important missing piece for multimessenger astrophysics.
