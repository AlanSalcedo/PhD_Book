# September 2023

### September 4<sup>th</sup> - September 8<sup>th</sup>

1. **ARA Birefringence:** Tested `Time_Diff_TwoRays()` on Justin's AraSim branch for SPICE pulser simulations. I am now getting results consistent with Amy's birefringence paper. At first I wasn't getting the right values so I had to try adding Uzair's ray tracing and Amy's n(z) index of refraction profile, as well as some debugging. Solving the puzzle took me 3 days from which I learned a potential problem regarding coordinates systems.

### September 11<sup>th</sup> - September 15<sup>th</sup>

1. **ARA 5-Station Analysis:** Finished A1 simulations (Finally!) by changing to Chiba's antenna gain model and reducing power threshold on noise-only simulations. Went ahead and did A4 simulations too. 

2. **ARA Birefringence: **
