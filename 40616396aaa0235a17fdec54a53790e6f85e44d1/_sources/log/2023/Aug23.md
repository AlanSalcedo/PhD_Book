## August 21<sup>st</sup> - August 25<sup>th</sup>

### Summary

1.  Worked through `cpol.cc` to find how time differences in rays are calculated. I think that I have studied this completely. Notes about this are written on the Birefringence section below.  

2.  Studied Maya's birefringence branch that seems to take parts of `cpol.cc` and convert them into functions defined in `birefringence.cc`.

3.  Added `Birefringence.cc` and `Birefringence.hh` into AraSim. I've only put two functions in there so far: `Read_Indicatrix_par()` and `Smooth_Indicatrix_par()` which are tweaked functions modularized from `cpol.cc` by Maya. Also, added `/data/birefringence` folder with the n1, n2, n3 data. See changes on this [GitHub PR](https://github.com/AlanSalcedo/AraSim/tree/Birefringence_Alan_New).

## August 28<sup>th</sup> - September 1<sup>st</sup>

## Summary

1. **ARA 5-Station Analysis:** Updated A1 simulations to use Chiba's antenna model and put files on [GitHub](https://github.com/AlanSalcedo/A1_simulations) to facilitate their use by other people.

2. **ARA 5-Station Analysis:** Addressed some comments on my A1 ATRI/ICRR GitHub PR.

3. **GENETIS Building:** Made straightened bicone model 2.5 mm thick and made of ABS plastic using Fusion 360 by recommendation of people from CART.
