### Coodinate Systems for Birefringence 

Remember these lines from L1489-1491 in `cpol.cc`?

> `rhat_thisstep[0]=-1.*(res[UZAIRSTEP]-res[0])*yhat[0]`
        `rhat_thisstep[1]=-1.*(res[UZAIRSTEP]-res[0])*yhat[1]`
        `rhat_thisstep[2]=-1.*(zs[UZAIRSTEP]-zs[0])`

At the time I didn't understand the details and they came back to haunt me, so I am going to explain them here. 

The TVector3 `rhat_thisstep` is a vector between two adjacent points (out of many) on a ray path solution from Tx to Rx. The question is: on what coordinate system are its components defined? 

Recall that `yhat` is a horizontal unit vector pointing from the SPICE pulser to the ARA station. Then `yhat[0]` and `yhat[1]` are the x and y components of this vector (for a unit vector these are the cosine and sine of the angle it makes with the x-axis). 

Looking at `cpol.cc` (L235), we see that the station and SPICE pulser coodinates are defined in the **surveyor's** coordinate system (Grid North, Grid East or Northing, Easting, **right?**).

Now the most important part. Our principal axes `n<sub>$\alpha$</sub>`, `n<sub>$\beta$</sub>`, and `n<sub>$\gamma$</sub>` are defined so that `n<sub>$\alpha$</sub>` is aligned with the direction of the ice flow (N36Â°)
